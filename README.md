##Descripion
TourKenya is a website designed for the kenyan tourism industry. Having noticed the low levels of awareness
of the people in our target markets,and the massive potential of the tourism industry in Kenya, we decided to build a site where we can advertise the beauty of Kenya and also make it convenient for tourists to make plans to visit our lovely country. Most people want to take a vacation somewhere in kenya but do not do so because the planning is too hectic. That is where we come in. All a user has to do is log in to the website,check out all the cool destinations and events, decide where and when to visit and we will do the rest,from transport,accomodation and offers,we got you covered. We host all the poplular tourist destinations,elite hotels, transport companies, air charters, spas, provide updates on weather,transport and security, and give you the best offers out there. We alao have reviews and feedback for the respective companies from other tourists to guide you in your decisions. Logging in to our site could mean the difference between an excellent vacation for you and your loved one, or a horrible trip to Africa. Come join us in enjoying our beautiful country.
